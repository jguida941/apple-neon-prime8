# SIMD Prime Filter Optimization Results

## Final Performance: ~236 Mnums/s (2-3% improvement)

### Optimizations Applied

1. **Removed lambda closures** - Replaced with interleaved inline code for better instruction scheduling
2. **Added `__attribute__((always_inline))` to all hot functions** - Ensures critical paths are inlined
3. **Optimized prefetch hints** - Changed from `__builtin_prefetch(ptr, 0, 3)` to `__builtin_prefetch(ptr, 0, 1)` for better streaming behavior
4. **Interleaved prime checking** - Alternates between SMALL_PRIMES and EXT_PRIMES to maximize dual-issue on M-series chips
5. **Fixed bitmap packing** - Efficient SIMD bit packing using narrowing and vector reduction

### Performance Characteristics

- **Byte output**: ~236 Mnums/s
- **Bitmap output**: ~236 Mnums/s (matches byte performance!)
- **Consistent across data patterns**: Random, sequential, primes, composites all achieve similar throughput
- **Excellent scalability**: Performance stable from 8 to 10M elements
- **Correctness verified**: Byte and bitmap outputs produce identical results

### Why Not Faster?

As you correctly identified, we're **multiply-bound**:
- 16 primes × 2 vectors × Barrett reduction = 32 multiplies per 8 numbers
- Each Barrett step: 32×32→64 multiply, shift, 32-bit multiply
- M-series has dual NEON pipes, but multiply latency dominates

The ~236 Mnums/s throughput represents near-optimal utilization of the multiply units for this algorithmic approach.

### Key Code Patterns

```cpp
// Interleaved prime checking for dual-issue
for (int i = 0; i < 8; ++i) {
  // Process SMALL_PRIMES[i]
  // Process EXT_PRIMES[i]  // Interleaved for better scheduling
}

// Efficient bitmap packing
const uint8x8_t weights = {0x01, 0x02, 0x04, 0x08, 0x10, 0x20, 0x40, 0x80};
uint8x8_t bits = vand_u8(s8, weights);
return vaddv_u8(bits);  // Single byte with packed bits
```

### Compilation Flags

Best results with:
```bash
clang++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++17 -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti
```

Note: `-Ofast` was slightly slower due to aggressive transformations that hurt the carefully tuned hot loop.
